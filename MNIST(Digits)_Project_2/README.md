# ML Engineering on AWS with Udacity\n\nThis repository contains the projects and exercises for the "Machine Learning Engineering on AWS" course by Udacity.\n\n## Project 2: MNIST Digits Classification\n\n### Overview\n\nIn this project, we build and train a model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n\n### Files\n\n- **MNIST-digits.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results visualization.\n- **MNIST-digits.html**: A static HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing.\n- **requirements.txt**: This file contains a list of all the dependencies required to run the notebook.\n\n### Setup\n\nTo set up the environment and run the notebook, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clone the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/MNLobago/ML_Engineering-AWS-Udacity-.git\n    cd ML_Engineering-AWS-Udacity-\n    ```\n\n2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**\n\n    ```bash\n    python3 -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`\n    ```\n\n3. **Install the required dependencies:**\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**\n\n    ```bash\n    jupyter notebook MNIST-digits.ipynb\n    ```\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe project requires the following libraries, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:\n\n- numpy\n- pandas\n- matplotlib\n- scikit-learn\n- tensorflow\n\n### Results\n\nThe notebook demonstrates the performance of the model using various metrics and visualizations. The trained model achieves high accuracy on the test set, showcasing its effectiveness in classifying handwritten digits.\n\n### License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n- Thanks to Udacity for providing the course and project guidelines.\n- The MNIST dataset is publicly available and widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
