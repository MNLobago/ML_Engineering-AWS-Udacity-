# Image Classification with Convolution

## Introduction

This repository contains code and resources related to image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It includes Jupyter notebooks, helper functions, and sample data for visualizing and understanding the concepts behind convolutional layers in CNNs.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing sample image data used for demonstrations.
- `notebook_ims/`: Directory containing images generated by Jupyter notebooks.
- `conv_visualization.html`: HTML file containing a visualization of convolutional layers (generated from a Jupyter notebook).
- `conv_visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating convolutional layer visualization.
- `helpers.py`: Python module containing helper functions for visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: File specifying the Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python and the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
You can explore the provided Jupyter notebooks and execute the code cells to visualize convolutional layers and understand their role in image classification.
